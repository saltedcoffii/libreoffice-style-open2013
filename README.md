# libreoffice-style-open2013
This is a libreoffice style designed to make the icons look like Microsoft Office 2013.

### Installation
Download the zip file from the [releases](https://github.com/saltedcoffii/libreoffice-style-open2013/releases) page.
##### Windows
Move the zip file to `C:\Program Files (x86)\Libreoffice <version number>\share\config

##### MacOS
Move the zip file to `LibreOffice/Contents/Resources/config

##### Linux
Move the zip file to, depending on how libreoffice is installed, `/usr/lib/libreoffice/share/config`, `/usr/share/libreoffice/share/config` or `/opt/libreoffice<version>/share/config`. If you aren't sure where to install it, put it in one place and create symlinks (`ln -s`) to the rest. Alternatively, some Linux users may use a prepackaged deb or rpm file from the [releases](https://github.com/saltedcoffii/libreoffice-style-open2013/releases) page if their libreoffice is not installed in `/opt`, and not installed as a flatpak or snap.

Open Libreoffice and go to *Tools > Options > LibreOffice > View* and change the icon style to Open2013. Restart Libreoffice if necessary.
